            <p>Yessir, that poor fella last night had the biggest case of broken heart I have ever seen! And when he said that he didn't know how he could live the rest of his life knowing how much hurt he'd caused that little girl? Well, I really felt for him. I did. Right here. (Saloon - Back Room) (Marty is crouched low as he looks out the window. Tannen now has Doc as a hostage.) Listen up, Eastwood! I intend to shoot somebody today and I'd prefer it to be you. But if you're just too damn yella, I guess it'll just have to be you're blacksmith friend. Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!</p>
